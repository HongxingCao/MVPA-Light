# MVPA-Light

Development branch. Functions might be unfinished, untested or buggy. Use at your own risk ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ

The branch also contains additional subfolders:

*  [`unittests`](unittests/): unit tests for all classifiers, the main classification functions, and the optimisers. [`run_all_unittests`](unittests/run_all_unittests.m) executes all unit tests and outputs the number of fails (hopefully none).
*  [`simulation`](simulation/): functions for creating simulated data. Used during unit testing.
