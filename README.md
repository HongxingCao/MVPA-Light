## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

In Linux/Mac, open a terminal and check out the repository by typing 

```
git clone https://github.com/treder/MVPA-Light.git
```
In Windows, you might prefer to perform these steps using a [Git client](https://www.google.com/search?q=git+client+for+windows). Alternatively, you can simply download the toolbox. Git makes it easier to keep your local version up-do-date using `git pull` but it's not essential. Next, the toolbox needs to be added to Matlab's search path. In Matlab, add these lines to your `startup.m` file:

```Matlab
addpath('C:\git\MVPA-Light\startup')
startup_MVPA_Light
```

This assumes that the repository is located in `C:\git\MVPA-Light`, so change the path if necessary. The function `startup_MVPA_Light` adds the relevant folders and it avoids adding the `.git` subfolder. 

If you do not want to use the `startup.m` file, you can directly add the `MVPA-Light` folder and its subfolders to the path using [MATLAB's Path tool](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/add-remove-or-reorder-folders-on-the-search-path.html).

`MVPA-Light` contains two branches: the `master` branch (recommended) is the stable branch that should always work. `devel` is the development branch that contains new features that are either under construction or not tested. The toolbox has been tested with Matlab `R2012a` and newer. There may be issues with earlier Matlab versions.

## Overview <a name="overview"></a>
`MVPA-Light` provides functions for the classification of neuroimaging data. It is meant to address the basic issues in MVPA (such as classification across time and generalisation) in a fast and robust way while retaining a slim and readable codebase. For Fieldtrip users, the use of the toolbox will be familiar: The first argument to the main functions is a configuration struct `cfg` that contains all the parameters. However, the toolbox does *not* require or use Fieldtrip.

Classifiers can be trained and tested by hand using the `train_*` and `test_*` functions. For data with a trial structure, such as ERP datasets, [`mv_classify_across_time`](mv_classify_across_time.m) can be used to obtain classification performance for each time point in a trial. [`mv_classify_timextime`](mv_classify_timextime.m) implements time generalisation, i.e., training on a specific time point, and testing the classifier on all other time points in a trial. Cross-validation, balancing unequal class proportions, and different performance metrics are automatically implemented in these functions.

## Classification <a name="classification"></a>

#### Introduction

<!---In cognitive neuroscience, the term *decoding* refers to the prediction of experimental conditions or mental states (output) based on multivariate brain data (input). The term *classification* means the same. Note that classification is the standard term in machine learning and many other disciplines whereas decoding is specific to cognitive neuroscience. *Multivariate pattern analysis* (MVPA) is an umbrella term that covers many multivariate methods such classification and related approaches such as Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA). --->

A *classifier* is the main workhorse of MVPA. The input brain data, e.g. channels or voxels, is referred to as *features*, whereas the output data is a *class label*. The classifier takes a feature vector as input and assigns it to a class. In `MVPA-Light`, class labels must be coded as `1` (for class 1), `2` (for class 2), `3` (for class 3), and so on.

<!-- *Example*: Assume that in a ERP-based memory paradigm, the goal is to predict whether an item is remembered or forgotten based on 128-channels EEG data. The target is single-trial ERPs at t=700 ms. Then, the feature vector for each trial consists of a 128-elements vector representing the activity at 700 ms for each electrode. Class labels are "remembered" (coded as +1) and "forgotten" (coded as -1). Note that the exact coding does not affect the classification.
-->

#### Training

In order to learn which features in the data discriminate between the experimental conditions, a classifier needs to be exposed to *training data*. During training, the classifier's parameters are optimised (analogous to determining the beta's in linear regression). All training functions start with `train_` (e.g. [`train_lda`](classifier/train_lda.m)).

#### Testing

Classifier performance is evaluated on a dataset called *test data*. To this end, the classifier is applied to samples from the test data. The class label predicted by the classifier can then be compared to the true class label in order to quantify classification performance. All test functions start with `test_` (e.g. [`test_lda`](classifier/test_lda.m)).

#### Classifiers for two classes

* [`lda`](classifier/train_lda.m): Regularised Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). LDA searches for a projection of the data into 1D such that the class means are separated as far as possible and the within-class variability is as small as possible. To counteract overfitting, ridge regularisation and shrinkage regularisation are available. In shrinkage, the regularisation parameter λ (lambda) rankges from λ=0 (no regularisation) to λ=1 (maximum regularisation). It can also be set to 'auto' to have λ be estimated automatically. For more details on regularised LDA see [[Bla2011]](#Bla2011). LDA has been shown to be formally equivalent to LCMV beamforming and it can be used for recovering time series of ERP sources [[Tre2011]](#Tre2011). See [`train_lda`](classifier/train_lda.m) for a full description of the parameters.
* [`logreg`](classifier/train_logreg.m): Logistic regression (LR) with L2-regularisation. LR directly models class probabilities by fitting a logistic function to the data. Like LDA, LR is a linear classifier and hence its operation is expressed by a weight vector w and a bias b. To prevent overfitting the regularisation parameter λ (lambda) is used to control the penalisation of the classifier weights.  λ has to be positive but its value is unbounded. It can also be set to 'auto'. In this case, different λ's are tried out using a searchgrid; the value of λ maximising cross-validation performance is then used for training on the full dataset. See [`train_logreg`](classifier/train_logreg.m) for a full description of the parameters.
* [`svm`](classifier/train_svm.m): Support Vector Machine (SVM). The parameter C is the cost parameter that controls the amount of regularisation. It is inversely related to the λ defined above. By default, a linear SVM is used. By setting the `.kernel` parameter (e.g. to 'polynomial' or 'rbf'), non-linear SVMs can be trained as well. See [`train_svm`](classifier/train_svm.m) for a full description of the parameters.
* [`ensemble`](classifier/train_ensemble.m): Uses an ensemble of classifiers trained on random subsets of the features and random subsets of the samples. Can use any classifier with train/test functions as a learner. See [`train_ensemble`](classifier/train_ensemble.m) for a full description of the parameters.

<!--
* `train_svm`, `test_svm`: Support vector machines (SVM). Uses the [LIBSVM package](https://github.com/arnaudsj/libsvm) that needs to be installed.
* `train_logist`, `test_logist`: Logistic regression classifier using Lucas Parra's implementation. See `external/logist.m` for an explanation of the hyperparameters.
-->

#### Multi-class classifiers (two or more classes)

* [`multiclass_lda`](classifier/train_multiclass_lda.m) : Regularised Multi-class Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The data is first projected onto a (C-1)-dimensional discriminative subspace, where C is the number of classes. A new sample is assigned to the class with the closest centroid in this subspace. See [`train_multiclass_lda`](classifier/train_multiclass_lda.m) for a full description of the parameters.

* [`kernel_fda`](classifier/train_kernel_fda.m) : Regularised [kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis (KFDA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_Fisher_discriminant_analysis). This is the kernelized version of LDA. By setting the `.kernel` parameter (e.g. to 'polynomial' or 'rbf'), non-linear classifiers can be trained. See [`train_kernel_fda`](classifier/train_kernel_fda.m) for a full description of the parameters.

#### Cross-validation

To obtain a realistic estimate of classifier performance and control for overfitting, a classifier should be tested on an independent dataset that has not been used for training. In most neuroimaging experiments, there is only one dataset with a restricted number of trials. *K-fold cross-validation* makes efficient use of this data by splitting it into k different folds. In each iteration, one of the k folds is held out and used as test set, whereas all other folds are used for training. This is repeated until every fold has been used as test set once. See [[Lemm2011]](#Lemm2011) for a discussion of cross-validation and potential pitfalls. Cross-validation is implemented in [`mv_crossvalidate`](mv_crossvalidate.m). Note that the more specialised functions [`mv_classify_across_time`](mv_classify_across_time.m), [`mv_classify_timextime`](mv_classify_timextime.m) and [`mv_searchlight`](mv_searchlight.m) implement cross-validation too. Cross-validation is always controlled by the following parameters:

* `cfg.cv`: cross-validation type, either 'kfold', 'leaveout' or 'holdout' (default 'kfold')
* `cfg.k`: number of folds in k-fold cross-validation (default 5)
* `cfg.repeat`: number of times the cross-validation is repeated with new randomly assigned folds (default 5)
* `cfg.p`: if cfg.cv is 'holdout', p is the fraction of test samples (default 0.1)
* `cfg.stratify`: if 1, the class proportions are approximately preserved in each test fold (default 1)


#### Classification across time
Many neuroimaging datasets have a 3-D structure (trials x channels x time). The start of the trial (t=0) typically corresponds to stimulus or response onset. Classification across time can help identify at which time point in a trial discriminative information shows up. To this end, classification is performed across trials, for each time point separately. This is implemented in the function [`mv_classify_across_time`](mv_classify_across_time.m). It returns classification performance calculated for each time point in a trial. [`mv_plot_result`](plot/mv_plot_result.m) can be used to plot the result.


#### Time x time generalisation

Classification across time does not give insight into whether information is shared across different time points. For example, is the information that the classifier uses early in a trial (t=80 ms) the same that it uses later (t=300ms)? In time generalisation, this question is answered by training the classifier at a certain time point t. The classifer is then tested at the same time point t but it is also tested at all *other* time points in the trial [[King2014]](#King2014). [`mv_classify_timextime`](mv_classify_timextime.m) implements time generalisation. It returns a 2D matrix of classification performance, with performance calculated for each combination of training time point and testing time point. [`mv_plot_result`](plot/mv_plot_result.m) can be used to plot the result.

#### Searchlight analysis

Which features contribute most to classification performance? The answer to this question can be used to better interpret the data or to perform feature selection. To this end, [`mv_searchlight`](mv_searchlight.m) performs cross-validated classification for each feature separately. If there is a spatial structure in the features (e.g. neighbouring eletrodes, neighbouring voxels), groups of features rather than single features can be considered. The result is a classification performance measure for each feature. If the features are e.g. channels, the result can be plotted as a topography.

#### Hyperparameter

The hyperparameter for each classifier can be controlled using the `cfg.param` field before calling any of the above functions. To this end, initialise the field using `cfg.param = []`. Then, add the desired parameters, e.g. `cfg.param.lambda = 0.5` for setting the regularisation parameter or `cfg.param.kernel = 'polynomial'` for defining the kernel in SVM. The hyperparameters for each classifier are specified in the documentation for each train_ function in the folder [`classifier`](classifier/).

#### Classifier performance metrics

Classifier output comes in form of decision values (=distances to the hyperplane for linear methods) or directly in form of class labels. However,  one is often only interested in a performance metric that summarises how well the classifier discriminates between the classes. The following metrics can be calculated by the function [`mv_calculate_performance`](utils/mv_calculate_performance.m):

* `accuracy` (can be abbreviated as `acc`): Classification accuracy, representing the fraction correctly predicted class labels.
* `auc`: Area under the [ROC curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic). An alternative to classification accuracy that is more robust to imbalanced classes and independent of changes to the classifier threshold.
* `confusion`: [confusion matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix). Rows corresponds to true class labels, columns correspond to predicted class labels. The (i,j)-th element gives the proportion of samples of class i that have been classified as class j.
* `dval`: Average decision value for each class.
* `f1`: [F1 score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) is the harmonic average of precision and recall, given by `2 *(precision * recall) / (precision + recall)`.
* `precision`: [precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall) is given as the number of true positives divided by true positives plus false positives. For multi-class, it is calculated per class from the confusion matrix by dividing each diagonal element by the row sum. 
* `recall`: [recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall) is given as the number of true positives divided by true positives plus false negatives. For multi-class, it is calculated per class from the confusion matrix by dividing each diagonal element by the respective column sum. 
* `tval`: for two classes, calculates the [t-test statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test#Equal_or_unequal_sample_sizes.2C_equal_variance) for unequal sample size, equal variance case, based on the decision values. Can be useful for a subsequent second-level analysis across subjects.
* `none`: Does not calculate a metric but returns the raw classifier output instead. 

There is usually no need to call [`mv_calculate_performance`](utils/mv_calculate_performance.m) directly. By setting the `cfg.metric` field, the performance metric is calculated automatically in [`mv_crossvalidate`](mv_crossvalidate.m), [`mv_classify_across_time`](mv_classify_across_time.m),  [`mv_classify_timextime`](mv_classify_timextime.m) and [`mv_searchlight`](mv_searchlight.m). You can provide a cell array of metrics, e.g. `cfg.metric = {'accuracy', 'confusion'}` to calculate multiple metrics at once.


## Examples<a name="examples"></a>

This section gives some basic examples. More detailed examples and data can be found in the [`examples/`](examples) subfolder.

#### Training and testing by hand

```Matlab

% Load data (in /examples folder)
[dat,clabel] = load_example_data('epoched3');

% Fetch the data from the 100th time sample
X = dat.trial(:,:,100);

% Get default hyperparameters for the classifier
param = mv_get_classifier_param('lda');

% Train an LDA classifier
cf = train_lda(param, X, clabel);

% Test classifier on the same data and get the predicted labels
predlabel = test_lda(cf, X);

% Calculate classification accuracy
acc = mv_calculate_performance('accuracy','clabel',predlabel,clabel)
```

See [`examples/example1_train_and_test.m`](examples/example1_train_and_test.m) for more details. In most cases, you would not perform training/testing by hand but rather call one of the high-level functions described below.

```Matlab
cfg = [];
cfg.classifier      = 'lda';
cfg.metric          = 'accuracy';
cfg.cv              = 'kfold';
cfg.k               = 5;
cfg.repeat          = 2;

% Perform 5-fold cross-validation with 2 repetitions.
% As classification performance measure we request accuracy (acc).
acc = mv_crossvalidate(cfg, X, clabel);
```

#### Which classifier should I use?

Note that all linear classifiers (LDA, Logistic regression, linear SVM) try to find a hyperplane that optimally separates the two classes. They only differ in the way ...
